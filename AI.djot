# AI.djot - AI Assistant Instructions for Sustainabot

## Machine-Readable Metadata

**CRITICAL:** This project has 6 machine-readable SCM files in `.machine_readable/6scm/`:

- **STATE.scm** - Current project state, milestones, completion status
- **ECOSYSTEM.scm** - Position in ecosystem, relationships to other projects
- **META.scm** - Architecture decisions (ADR format), development practices, design rationale
- **PLAYBOOK.scm** - Operational procedures, troubleshooting, alerts, runbooks
- **AGENTIC.scm** - AI agent interaction patterns, constraints, workflows
- **NEUROSYM.scm** - Neurosymbolic integration config (symbolic + neural layers)

**You MUST read these files at the start of each session** to understand the project context, current state, and operational guidelines.

These files are the **single source of truth** for:
- Project status and progress
- Architectural decisions and rationale  
- Operational procedures
- AI agent interaction patterns
- Integration with the broader ecosystem

## File Specifications

The 6 SCM files follow standardized formats:

- **Format Spec:** See `hyperpolymath/meta-scm` repository for detailed specifications
- **Schema:** Guile Scheme S-expressions
- **Maintenance:** Update STATE.scm at end of each session, update others when decisions/architecture change
- **Validation:** Files must be valid Scheme and parseable

## Project Context

**Project:** Sustainabot  
**Purpose:** Ecological and economic code analysis - dependency health, license compliance, maintenance burden  
**Tier:** Gitbot Fleet member  
**Language:** Rust (primary), Guile Scheme (config/state)

## Language Policy

### ALLOWED
- Rust (primary application code)
- Guile Scheme (SCM files only)
- Bash (minimal scripts)
- TOML (configuration)

### BANNED
- TypeScript, Node.js, npm
- Python
- Go
- Java/Kotlin

## Development Guidelines

1. **Before making changes:** Read all 6 SCM files to understand context
2. **During work:** Follow patterns in AGENTIC.scm
3. **Operational issues:** Consult PLAYBOOK.scm
4. **After completion:** Update STATE.scm with accomplishments
5. **Architectural changes:** Document in META.scm as ADRs

## SCM File Maintenance

**When to update each file:**

- **STATE.scm** - Every session (update completion %, accomplishments)
- **ECOSYSTEM.scm** - When relationships to other projects change
- **META.scm** - When making architectural decisions or design changes
- **PLAYBOOK.scm** - When adding/changing operational procedures
- **AGENTIC.scm** - When AI interaction patterns evolve
- **NEUROSYM.scm** - When symbolic/neural integration changes

## Security

- SPDX License: PMPL-1.0-or-later
- No hardcoded secrets
- SHA-pinned dependencies

## Fleet Integration

This bot is part of the **gitbot-fleet** coordinated by **hypatia**.

- Receives rulesets from hypatia registry
- Reports findings back to fleet
- Operates according to tier responsibilities
- Coordinates with sibling bots

See ECOSYSTEM.scm for detailed fleet relationships.
